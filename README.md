`artifact id: lambda-maven-plugin`<br />
`version: 2.3.2`<br />
<br/><br/>
Please note that the artifact has been renamed from lambduh-maven-plugin to
lambda-maven-plugin.

### Deploy from command line
```
mvn package shade:shade lambda:deploy-lambda
```

### Delete from command line
```
mvn lambda:delete-lambda
```

### Configuration
All of the AWS Lambda configuration parameters may be set within the lambda plugin configuration or on the Maven command line using the -D directive.

* `accessKey` Your user's AWS access key.
* `secretKey` Your user's AWS secret access key.
* `functionCode` REQUIRED The location of your deliverable. For instance, a jar file for a Java8 lambda function.
* `version` REQUIRED version of the deliverable. Note that this is the version you assign to your function, not the one assigned by AWS when publish=true.
* `alias` OPTIONAL, but requires publish=true.  Assigns an alias to the AWS version of this function.  Useful for maintaining versions intended for different environments on the same function.  For instance, development, qa, production, etc.
* `s3Bucket` REQUIRED Defaults to lambda-function-code. The AWS S3 bucket to which to upload your code from which it will be deployed to Lambda.
* `region` Defaults to us-east-1 The AWS region to use for your function.
* `runtime` Defaults to Java8 Specifies whether this is Java8, NodeJs and Python.
* `lambdaRoleArn` REQUIRED The ARN of the AWS role which the lambda user will assume when it executes. Note that the role must be assumable by Lambda and must have Cloudwatch Logs permissions and AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole policy.
* `lambdaFunctions` Lamda functions that can be configured using tags in pom.xml.
* `lambdaFunctionsJSON` JSON configuration for Lambda Functions. This is preferable configuration.
* `timeout` Defaults to 30 seconds. The amount of time in which the function is allowed to run.
* `memorySize` Defaults to 1024MB NOTE: Please review the AWS Lambda documentation on this setting as it could have an impact on your billing.
* `vpcSubnetIds` The VPC Subnets that Lambda should use to set up your VPC configuration. Format: "subnet-id (cidr-block) | az name-tag".
* `vpcSecurityGroupIds` The VPC Security Groups that Lambda should use to set up your VPC configuration. Format: "sg-id (sg-name) | name-tag". Should be configured.
* `publish` This boolean parameter can be used to request AWS Lambda to update the Lambda function and publish a version as an atomic operation. This is global for all functions and won't overwrite publish paramter in provided Lambda configuration. Setting to false will only update $LATEST.
* `functionNameSuffix` The suffix for the lambda function. Function name is automatically suffixed with it. When left blank no suffix will be applied.
* `forceUpdate` This boolean parameter can be used to force update of existing configuration. Use it when you don't publish a function and want to deploy code in your Lambda function.
* `triggers` A list of one or more triggers that execute Lambda function. Currently `CloudWatch Events - Schedule`, `SNS`, `DynamoDB` and `Kinesis` are supported. When `functionNameSuffix` is present then suffix will be added automatically.
* `environmentVariables` Map to define environment variables for Lambda functions enable you to dynamically pass settings to your function code and libraries, without making changes to your code. Deployment functionality merges those variables with the one provided in json configuration.
* `keepAlive` When specified, a CloudWatch event is scheduled to "ping" your function every X minutes, where X is the
 value you specify.  This keeps your lambda function resident and ready to receive real requests at all times.  This is
 useful for when you need your function to be responsive.
* `passThrough` This directive is to be used only on the command line.  It allows you to pass environment variables from the command line to your functions using json. Example:
```
mvn package shade:shade lambda:deploy-lambda -DpassThrough="{'KEY1' : 'VAL1', 'KEY2' : 'VAL2'}"
```
* `kmsEncryptionKeyArn` The AWS KMS encryption key you wish to use to encrypt/decrypt sensitive environment variables.
* `encryptedPassThrough` Similar to passThrough (see above), but these variables will be encrypted using the KMS encryption key specified above. Requires that kmsEncryptionKeyArn is specified.
* `clientConfiguration` Allows you to specify a http(s) proxy when communicating with AWS. The following parameters may be specified, see the Example configuration below for an example.
  * `protocol`
  * `proxyHost`
  * `proxyPort`
  * `proxyDomain`
  * `proxyUsername`
  * `proxyPassword`
  * `proxyWorkstation`

Current configuration of LambdaFunction can be found in LambdaFunction.java.

### A Note About Environment Variables
Environment variables set by this plugin respect the following hierarchy:
1. Variables set within the AWS Lambda Console.
2. Variables set within the Configuration block of the plugin (See above).
3. Variables set within the JSON lambda function descriptors (See above).
4. Pass through variables defined on the command line when deploying the function.

Variables defined at a higher level (top of the list above) may be overridden by those at a lower level.

### Credentials
Your AWS credentials may be set on the command line or in the plugin configuration. If `accessKey` and
`secretKey` are not explicitly defined, the plugin will look for them in your environment or in your
~/.aws/credentials file

IAM permissions required by this plugin:
* action `s3:GetObject` and `s3:PutObject` on resource `arn:aws:s3:::<s3Bucket>/*`
* action `s3:ListBucket` on resource `arn:aws:s3:::<s3Bucket>`
* action `s3:CreateBucket` if you want the plugin to create the S3 bucket you specify.
* action `lambda:CreateFunction`
* action `lambda:InvokeFunction`
* action `lambda:GetFunction`
* action `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`
* action `lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration`
* action `lambda:ListAliases`
* action `events:PutRule` on  resource `arn:aws:events:<region>:<acount-number>:rule/*`
* action `events:PutTargets` on  resource `arn:aws:events:<region>:<acount-number>:rule/*`
* action `kinesis:GetRecords, GetShardIterator, DescribeStream, and ListStreams on Kinesis streams`

### Developers
If you are interested in contributing to this project, please note that current development can be found in the SNAPSHOT branch of the coming release.  When making pull requests, please create them against this branch.

A test harness has been provided which can be run with `mvn test` Please use
this and feel free to add additional tests. Note that the basic-pom.xml file
requires you to add your role arn in order to work.  As such, basic-pom.xml
has been added to .gitignore so that you don't accidentally commit your role
to the file.  If you add more pom's as part of enhancing the test suite,
please remember to add them to .gitignore.

### Releases
